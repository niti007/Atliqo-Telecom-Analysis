# Atliqo-Telecom-Analysis

AtliQo is one of the leading telecom providers in India and launched its 5G plans in May 2022 along with other telecom providers.
However, the management noticed a decline in their active users and revenue growth post-5G launch in May 2022. Atliqoâ€™s business director requested their analytics team to provide a comparison report of KPIs between pre and post-periods of the 5G launch. The management is keen to compare the performance between these periods and get insights that enable them to make informed decisions to recover their active user rate and other vital metrics.

Tasks Given :
Create a dashboard for executive management to provide insights on revenue and active users in informing of comparison reports between pre and post-periods of 5G Launch based on metrics given.
